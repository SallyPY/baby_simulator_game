# Baby Simulator Game

This is a simple beginner project developed using only parts from the official Arduino Starter Kit. 

In each round, the user must do one of three actions: feed the baby milk, shut the blinds, or sing a lullaby. When the baby is fed/a switch is pressed, the servo/milk bottle moves. The blinds are shut by covering the photoresister. The piezo plays a lullaby when a switch is pressed. The users must pass three rounds before getting three strikes to win.
